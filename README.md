![logo](lifemeterlogo4040.png) Time Tracker by Team TrojanStars
===========

Time Tracker is a Chrome Extension made by 5 USC students for Trojanhacks-a 24 hour hackathon.  
The extension is a pop-up that displays time spent in different categories of web browsing.  The overall purpose for users is to self-evaluate web browsing produtivity.

We hoped that this application could be a fun way for users to track how they spend their time on the web. The goal is to increase productivity with a fun and easy to use UI.
